 * `parachute-agent/src/web/services-manifest.ts` deliberately — the file
 * shape is the contract between every Parachute module and the hub
 * (`parachute-hub/src/services-manifest.ts` is the canonical reader).
 *
 * Failure mode: any write error is logged + swallowed by the caller. Self-
 * registration is best-effort — the daemon still serves locally even if
 * the manifest write fails (permissions, disk full, race with another
 * writer, malformed pre-existing file).
 *
 * `installDir` is the third-party-module hook (parachute-hub#84): hub
 * looks the field up to resolve `parachute restart scribe` back to the
 * checkout it should drive. Self-registering it here means scribe doesn't
 * need a vendored fallback in hub once vault#266 + runner#3 + scribe#38
 * retire `SCRIBE_FALLBACK` from `parachute-hub/src/service-spec.ts`.
